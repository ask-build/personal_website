My work lives at the intersection of data strategy and healthcare, focused on turning vast amounts of raw data into something that can guide real decisions. Over the last decade, I’ve learned that the real value in data isn’t just in collection but in clarity—understanding what matters and making it useful.

Today, I’m an Associate Director of Data Strategy and Governance at BeiGene, where I oversee how data flows across commercial and medical functions, ensuring it’s aligned, timely, and reliable. I work with data aggregators, set acquisition strategies, and shape governance to create a framework that lets data answer questions before they’re even asked.

I’ve spent years across Jazz Pharmaceuticals, ZS Associates, and Saama, where I honed the art of connecting business goals with data insights. My Executive MBA has given me another lens—one that sees data not as a byproduct but as a tool for leverage.

Outside of work, I follow what fascinates me: Sci-Fi, stargazing, longevity, reading, and travel. Each of these reminds me to look further and think beyond, shaping how I approach data and life.

Thanks for stopping by.
